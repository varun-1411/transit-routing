Trip-based Public Transit Routing
===========================================

TBTR solves the bicriterion (travel time and transfer) optimization problem using trips and trip-transfersas building blocks. TBTRâ€™s search pattern is similarto RAPTOR, but unlike RAPTOR, it does not maintain multi-labels for all stops). TBTR involves a preprocessing and query phase. In its preprocessing  phase, using the GTFS set, we collect all optimal  trip-transfers. The query phase then uses these trip-transfers to answer bicriterion shortest path queries. The codes below only contain the query phase. Currently supported versions are:
