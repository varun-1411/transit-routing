Transfer Patterns
===========================================

Transfer Patterns solves the bicriterion (travel time and transfer) optimization problem. It is the currently one of fastest bicriteria journey planning algorithm in public transit networks. It has a seperate preprocessing phase and query phase. Given a soruce stop, the preprocessing phase involves finding all optimal journeys to all other stops. Transfer patterns correspoding to these optimal journeys are extracted. The query phase then uses a multicriteria dijkstra's algorithm on a graph constructed using the previosly computed transfer patters. Currently supported versions are:
